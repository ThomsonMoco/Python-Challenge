The code which changed my perspective

This code was created in order to sort marks for different students. The approach I utilized included a while loop in order to count variables as well as incrementors that we had learnt that year. 

Through this while loop I was able to append lists in a much more effective manner than sorting the marks manually.

We had just begun uaing arrays and it really opened my eyes to the world of cosing as it changed the way I viewed characters and programming. Before this I thought in a very 2D way but loops and arrays gave me a new perspective and dimensionn whch I genuinely enjoyeed.
