The code which changed my perspective

This code was created in order to sort marks for different students. The approach I utilized included a while loop in order to count variables as well as incrementors that we had learnt that year. 

Through this while loop I was able to append lists in a much more effective manner than sorting the marks manually. The way to end the loop and view the sorted results is to enter a negative mark.

We had just begun using arrays and it really opened my eyes to the world of coding as it changed the way I viewed characters and programming. Before this I thought in a very 2D way but loops and arrays gave me a new perspective and dimensionn which I genuinely enjoyed.
